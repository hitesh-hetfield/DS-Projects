## Introduction

The Student Performance Dataset is a dataset designed to examine the factors influencing academic student performance. The dataset consists of 10,000 student records, each containing information about various predictors and a performance index.
The goal is:
  - Building a model that can predict an accurate performance index based on the input features.

## Data Source
This data set is taken from Kaggle, the link to which is: 
  - kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression/data

## Features

This is a highly detailed and explanatory project for beginners looking to get their hands dirty with Exploratory Data Analysis and Linear Regression.

- Exploratory Data Analysis of Categorical and Numerical Variables.
- Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Normal Equation.
- Using Gradient Descent and Cost Function.
- Getting MAE, MSE, and RMSE in billions.
- Getting negative values for R2 and Adjusted R2 score. 

## Learnings

This project taught me several things:
- Getting comfortable with working with a relatively large and noisy dataset.
- How to deal with getting really poor performing metrics and model, and how to deal with it by building a better one.
- Using and showcasing several Python techniques and libraries:
  1. Numpy
  2. Pandas
  3. Scipy
  4. Matplotlib
  5. Seaborn
  6. Scikit Learn
- Using techniques like:
  1. Outlier Detection
  2. Identifying Input Features and Target Variable.
  3. Visualizing different graphs for different variables.
  4. Visualizing relationships amongst different variables.
- Employing Gradient Descent to build the initial Multiple Linear Regression Model.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing splits.
- Visualising the predictions and actual values via scatterplot.
- Using Regression Performance Metrics to check the accuracy of our model:
    1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    3. Root Mean Squared Error (RSME)
    4. R2 Score (R2)
    5. Adjusted R2 Score (Adj R2)
- Employing OLS and Normal Equation to build the second Multiple Linear Regression Model.
- Feature Scaling
  1. Using Z-Score Normalization to scale the input features for a better and more accurate model.
- Visualising the predictions and actual values via scatterplot.
- Using Regression Performance Metrics to check the accuracy of our model:
    1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    3. Root Mean Squared Error (RSME)
    4. R2 Score (R2)
    5. Adjusted R2 Score (Adj R2)
- Comparing the 2 Models and concluding the project.
